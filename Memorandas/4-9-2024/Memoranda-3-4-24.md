**@ 12:11:05 | From Michael**  
**Presentation**  
* Mention interesting design decisions and testing results  
* Examples of interesting decisions  
* Bad: Don't talk about simple, obvious design decisions, e.g. buildings are on the sides  
* Good: Talk about more substantial and interesting decisions that reflect the design of your project  
  
**@ 12:11:43 | From Michael**  
**Misc**  
* Status report this week is for Cycle 1, not Cycle 2, but can include some stuff about Cycle 2  
  
**@ 13:18:42 | From Michael**  
**DESIGN DOC CONFUSION**  
* Constraints: What needs to happen and what can't happen  
* Design docs: How the feature will function while obeying these constraints  
* Our problem: Constraints were too specific and ended up partially replacing our design docs

I assume josh will probably  do the demo recording since Michael is doing the memoranda thing but if either of you want to change that we can do that too  
  
**@ 15:45:28 | From Michael**  
@Josh If you could do the demo recording that would be helpful, but I can do it if needed.  
Also I can do the printing for deliverables, just make sure that whatever stuff you worked on (feature descriptions, etc.) are ready to go before Tuesday night.  
  
**@ 15:45:45 | From Josh | Replying to Michael: "<@544680424954134533> If you could do th..."**  
I can make the demo video
