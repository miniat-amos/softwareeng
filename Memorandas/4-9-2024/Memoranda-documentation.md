Cleaned up and submitted the status report a minute ago

Also, just made this channel since so that we have somewhere separate for discussing documentation, reports, etc.

@everyone Make sure everything you've done this week is in the status report sometime tonight. Dylan added most of what we need, and I did some touching up, so just make sure to add in all of your hours at the bottom (which I'll add under features before I submit the report), and take a quick look at the objectives/accomplishments to make sure everything looks good. I think the only thing missing is the current status of the Game Over feature, other than that the report should be nearly ready to go.
