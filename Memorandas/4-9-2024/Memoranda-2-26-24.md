* Before developing test suite / writing code, you should sit with teammates and make decisions, create documentation, etc.  
* I.e. any decision that the user can see has to be made together and made before testing/coding/etc  
* If there is a specific test or user-visible decision that doesn't map back to design docs, that's a sign that you should update the design docs
