**@ 12:12:00 | From Dylan**  
To create a flexible, hierarchical, extensible framework for our final game. The framework will include player movement, collision, and visual management, demonstrated in a playable simple game.  
  
**@ 12:12:00 | From Michael**  
* Establish documentation methods & roles  
* Today: Come up with a written version of system intent (one sentence, maybe two, no technical details)  
* Same thing with cycle intent, looser guidelines, but should lack detailed / technical information (user & deliverable focused)  
  
**Status reports**  
* Status reports are due weekly on Sundays at 5pm  
* Don't switch to portrait; leave in landscape  
* Each report covers the previous week's work  
* Include copy of system intent (may change during development)  
* Leave the text alone except for the bullets, which you will delete and fill out  
* Make sure accomplishments are finite / concrete, and identify who make these accomplishments in parentheses at the end  
* Obstacles  - Things that prevent you from moving forward and need to be overcome.   
* Risks  - Risks in moving forward beyond this report; future obstacles.  
* Neither risks nor obstacles should be "whines", e.g. not enough time, etc.  
* Objectives  - Deliverable goals for the team over the next week. Essentially, an accomplishment you want to put down next week. Should be able to copy and past objectives into next week's accomplishments.   
* Accomplishments  - Identify concretely what is done, not "this is *mostly* done"  
* Shouldn't over- or underachieve. Objectives and accomplishments should be a near-match, so try to plan your objectives accurately.   
* Feature matrix  - List of features. A theme is considered a feature. A row in the column is one feature, and its description can take up multiple lines (not rows).   
* Remember to record hours worked for the feature matrix  
* Work should be distributed evenly, meaning everyone should test/assist/code (roughly) evenly  
* Current status  - Identify as clearly as possible the status of that feature. *Never* just say "in between" or "in progress." Be specific.   
* Complete means it has been fully developed and tested.  
* Features must be user-focused (e.g. a state-machine isn't a feature)

To create an endless runner video game where the player collects loot and avoids enemies, particularly evil lightning bolts, in a Wild West-style town.

To create an endless runner video game where the player collects loot in a wild western town and avoids enemies (particular evil lightning bolts) along the way. This game will include all aspects of the reference image.  (maybe don't need to mention the refence image)  
  
**@ 12:23:38 | From Dylan**  
- Team should submit weekly status reports by each Sunday at 5 pm  
  
**@ 12:29:04 | From Dylan**  
- Risks are things we worry about *becoming* obstacles in the future  
  
**@ 12:34:28 | From Dylan**  
- Write features in terms of the user (ex. "screen follows player" instead of "camera"  
  
**@ 12:36:47 | From Dylan**  
- In cycle 1, hours on a feature this cycle = total hours on the feature  
  
**@ 12:37:23 | From Dylan**  
- Coders and testers for features must not overlap  
  
**@ 12:38:19 | From Dylan**  
- Everyone should do about the same amount of coding and testing  
  
**@ 12:41:19 | From Dylan**  
- Don't write that features are literally "somewhere in between" started and completed, rather say something like "awaiting tests" or "programming completed"

Review of the gameâ€™s features and roughly plan their implementations  
Movable player  
Camera  
Basic UI (health and loot)  
Basic collisions (with loot and walls)  
  
**@ 13:08:11 | From Dylan**  
Lightning  
  
**@ 13:08:37 | From Michael**  
* Each cycle's intent needs to clearly reflect the unique aspects of the game  
  
**@ 13:21:38 | From Dylan**  
A video game featuring a controllable player who has to avoid lightning bolts in a Wild West town.

**Meeting Summary**  
- Adjusted our plan so that we'll have a more complete game by the end of cycle 1.  
- Discussed and wrote the system and cycle intent.  
- Discussed how to create test suites.  
- Work between meetings:   
  - (Dylan)  - Player feature  
  - (Michael)  - Map feature  
  - (Josh)  - Camera / Map Exploration feature
