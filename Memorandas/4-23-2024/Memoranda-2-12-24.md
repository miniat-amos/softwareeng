Notes from the presentations:  
  
**@ 12:17:54 | From Josh**  
- Don't say "I"  - the group did this!  
  
**@ 12:50:09 | From Josh**  
- make clear demos  
  
**@ 12:50:28 | From Josh**  
- ensure music is not too loud (overshadows our own voice)  
  
**@ 12:50:53 | From Dylan**  
- Demos must be explained so that they have significance rather than just being something meaningless/something the viewer doesn't understand  
**Reactions:** üëç  
  
**@ 12:53:11 | From Dylan**  
- Watch time and don't forget slides or end presentation early  
- If you make a non-critical mistake in presentation, don't point it out, just skip it (e.g. the group with the introductions)  
  
**@ 13:27:48 | From Dylan**  
- Don't include unexplained code in presentation
