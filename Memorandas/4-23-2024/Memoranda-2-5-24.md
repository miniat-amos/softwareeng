- Perhaps look at cycle grading rubric for general idea of presentation grading  
- Have at least a general concept of how presentation will be formatted, no talking over each other etc  
  
**@ 12:10:50 | From Dylan**  
- Save slides (if we use them) locally on at least 2 team members' computers  
- Record a video of the game in case it won't load, can't be accessed, etc

Dylan's comments +   
  
**To do**  
* Add collisions to Map.py  
* Use proper sprites for player  
* Lighting collisions (between player, and roof if time allows)  
* Presentation  
* Discuss cycle plans (mostly game concept)
