**@ 12:23:57 | From Josh**  
Lessons learned from group presentations:  
- Include details about testing  
- Have your music not too loud (if this happens to us we can immediately show off the music options feature to lower it)  
  
**@ 13:09:20 | From Michael**  
* Tie design changes back to testing (will probably ask him about it more)  
  * Show an example of testing changing design?  
* Having short demo videos play while explaining a feature may be better than using a full demo at the end  
  
**@ 13:42:33 | From Michael**  
* Cycle 3 will go through finals week  
* Presentation on last day of class  
* Peer evals will be submitted last day of class  
* Final exam time: Show final demo and build instructions and stuff  
  * 12:45 Monday  
  * Fresh clone of repo -> Fully built and functional game  
  * Concept of deployment -> Average person should be able to run it from somewhat arbitrary directory (e.g. from a shortcut on desktop)  
    * Can use environment variables  
    * Can use detailed instructions, but they need to be clear and reasonable to follow  
* Remember to include deployment info in Tools/Invironment  
  
**@ 13:49:41 | From Dylan**
