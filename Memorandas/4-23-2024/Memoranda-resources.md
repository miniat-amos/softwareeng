I wrote up a google doc with all the rules/mechanics for this game. I tried to make it detailed, but I hope it's not too verbose. Feel free to make comments and suggest changes, I'm not too attached to any of these ideas lol.

added bridge and railroad and separate files for just the ceilings to overlay over the player  
also versions with just the sides for collision

idrk how collision works but i think one way i saw has to do with getting a map of collision from an image

Ok sweet! Iâ€™m going to hammer down on some camera code in a little bit

Found a decent source for 8-bit sound effects. Licensing varies from asset to asset, but I think confer said we only had to focus on licensing for code anyways.
